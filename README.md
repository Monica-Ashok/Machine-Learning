Election Exit Poll Prediction and U.S.A Presidential Speech Analysis using Machine Learning

Vote Prediction and Text Analysis are the two case studies on which this study is based. 

The goal of the first study is to forecast which party a citizen will support based on their age and the responses they provided when a survey was done. 

The second research is based on an analysis of remarks at the U.S. President's inauguration. Based on the examination of these remarks, conclusions must be drawn.
